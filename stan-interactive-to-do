Plan:
  need controls for thinning and discarding early samples
  need to display multiple chains - either as superimposed line charts or densities
  display chain(s) as quantiles within sample index number bands
    perhaps there are 100 index bands on the screen
    the 40-60th centile is the darkest rectangle, then the 25-40 & 60-75, etc.
  calculate and show r hat and effective sample size, DIC, GLR?
  splines over chains
  drop-down list to choose parameters for chains
