Plan:
  need controls for thinning and discarding early samples
  need to display multiple chains - either as superimposed line charts or densities
    the chains need to turn into nesting (see test-auto.html)
    then they can be separated for the line chart or combined in the crossfilter
  display chain(s) as quantiles within sample index number bands
    perhaps there are 100 index bands on the screen
    the 40-60th centile is the darkest rectangle, then the 25-40 & 60-75, etc.
  calculate and show r hat and effective sample size, DIC, GLR?
  splines over chains
  drop-down list to choose parameters for chains
  text box input to:
    drop first n samples from data
    likewise for thinning
    and excluding chains
